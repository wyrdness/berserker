## Overview

Berserkers were Norse warriors who fought in an uncontrollable, trance-like fury during the Viking Age. The name derives from "bear-shirt" (wearing bear pelts) or possibly "bare-chested". Before battle, they worked themselves into a rage state characterized by superhuman strength, immunity to pain and fear, and frenzied killing that did not discriminate between friend and foe.

Physical symptoms included shaking, chattering teeth, and extreme body heat, followed by deep fatigue after the battle-rage passed. Ulfhednar were similar wolf-warriors who wore wolf pelts.

Berserkers were dedicated to Odin and served as elite warriors and bodyguards during the Viking Age. They were later outlawed in medieval Iceland due to their unpredictable violence.
